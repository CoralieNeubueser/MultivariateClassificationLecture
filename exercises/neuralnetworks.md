## Exercise 1

  1. Find a suitable network architecture to solve the first classification problem.
  1. Add some noise to the dataset (e.g. choose 40 as the noise value) and increase the number of hidden layers and neurons.
     Observe the Test and Training loss during the training and compare them to one another.
  1. Increase the regularization rate and set the Regularization to L2. 
     Observe the Test and Training loss during the training and compare them to one another.
  1. On the left you can change the underlying signal and background distribution. Find suitable network architectures to solve them.
  1. Choose "Regression" as "Problem Type" in the upper right corner. Find suitable network architectures to solve the regression problems.
